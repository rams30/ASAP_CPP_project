# ASAP_CPP_project
The Anti-Cheating Seating Arrangement Plan (ASAP) is a software project that is coded in C++ and uses matrix operations to help invigilators prevent cheating during exams. The goal of the project is to have software that can assign seats to students based on their degree programs, exam subjects, and previous performance. The software also monitors the students' behavior during the exam and alerts the invigilator if any suspicious activity is detected. The ACMS is designed to be efficient, secure, and user-friendly. It can handle different types of exams, such as multiple-choice, short-answer, or essay questions. The ACMS can also generate reports and statistics on the exam results and the student's performance. The ACMS is a novel and innovative solution to the problem of cheating in exams, which can affect the quality and integrity of education.
